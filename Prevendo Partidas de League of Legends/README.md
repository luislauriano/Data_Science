# League of Legends and Data Science - Predicting match results

What happens if I join League of Legends and Data Science?

Well, this is my newest Machine Learning project, defined as an end-to-end project, going from collecting match data to building a machine learning model, to predicting the odds of the time you are playing. on the blue side of the map to win. Performing steps such as: Pre-processing and data analysis, dimensionality reduction and selection of variables, and construction of both a model completed with XGBClassifier, and construction of a logistic regression model from the results obtained from AutoML with Pycaret.
